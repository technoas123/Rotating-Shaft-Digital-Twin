Perfect—your directory tree is nicely organized, and your November 6 milestone (“Core Code + Baseline Simulation + Test Plan”) gives you a focused target. Below is a **4‑day work plan** that aligns with your folder structure and keeps progress both disciplined and measurable. The tone: efficient engineer with just enough humor to keep the caffeine flowing.

## **4‑Day Work Plan – Toward November 6 Deadline**

### **Goal**
Deliver a functioning MATLAB Simulink model of the rotating shaft digital twin (baseline simulation) with clear code structure, documentation, and validation plots stored neatly in your repo.

---

### **📅 Day 1 – Model Setup & Parameter Definition**
**Objective:** Establish physical model foundation in `models/` and document design choices.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Review literature or reference models to finalize equations for shaft, motor, and bearing subsystems.  
- [ ] Define parameters: shaft inertia, stiffness, damping, torque input, angular velocity range.  
- [ ] Build initial *Simscape Multibody* assembly (motor → shaft → load).  
- [ ] Save Simulink file (`models/shaft_twin_base.slx`).  
- [ ] Write a short `README.md` in `docs/` describing model structure and assumptions.

**Deliverables**
- Functional Simscape diagram for core shaft system.  
- Parameter table documented under `docs/model_specifications.md`.

---

### **📅 Day 2 – Simulation Logic & Data Layer**
**Objective:** Bring the model to life; implement data capture and reproducibility.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Add sensor blocks (virtual tachometer, torque sensor, vibration signal).  
- [ ] Configure simulation inputs: nominal torque step or sine disturbance.  
- [ ] Verify system behaves stably—plot angular speed and torque.  
- [ ] Export sensor outputs to `.mat` files under `data/`.  
- [ ] Create a driver script: `scripts/run_baseline_simulation.m` to automate model loading, run, and data saving.

**Deliverables**
- First baseline run producing usable raw data.  
- Organized `.mat` files under `data/` folder.

---

### **📅 Day 3 – Fault Injection & Analysis**
**Objective:** Demonstrate normal vs. faulty behavior for comparison plots.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Introduce a parameterized imbalance (slight mass offset or torque ripple).  
- [ ] Run both healthy and faulty simulations.  
- [ ] Apply FFT and RMS analysis using Signal Processing Toolbox.  
- [ ] Save processed data and plots (`results/vibration_fft.png`, etc.).  
- [ ] Update documentation in `docs/fault_analysis_notes.md`.

**Deliverables**
- Verified difference between healthy and faulty outputs.  
- FFT figure showing characteristic imbalance frequency.

---

### **📅 Day 4 – Testing, Packaging, & Reporting**
**Objective:** Validate, tidy repo, and prepare submission materials.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Write quick regression test scripts in `tests/` to confirm model runs, data saved, and no NaN values.  
- [ ] Review code cleanliness: paths, comments, and variable naming.  
- [ ] Generate minimum presentation figures (speed vs. time, torque comparison).  
- [ ] Compile a concise technical report (`docs/baseline_simulation_summary.pdf`).  
- [ ] Commit and push all changes to GitHub with a descriptive tag, e.g., `v0.9-baseline`.

**Deliverables**
- Clean, reproducible codebase hosting your baseline simulation.  
- Report ready for the November 6 milestone submission.

### **End‑of‑Cycle Output Structure**

```
data/          -> Raw and processed simulation data (.mat)
docs/          -> Specifications, fault analysis, summary report
models/        -> Simulink and Simscape models (.slx)
results/       -> Generated plots, FFT/RMS results
scripts/       -> Automation and setup scripts
tests/         -> Sanity and regression checks
```

Four focused days—model, simulate, analyze, and wrap. You’ll cross the November 6 finish line with a properly spinning shaft, a predictive story, and an impressively tidy repository.
